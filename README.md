# Modern React Development <br>
In this repository, I'll be implementing several UI layouts and SPA's for my portfolio.<br>
More Coming Soon!


## Things to remember from docs:
- React components are JavaScript functions that return markup.
- React component names must always start with a capital letter.
- The <code>export default</code> keywords specify the main component in the file.
- In React, you specify a CSS class with <code>className</code> . It works the same way as the HTML class attribute.

## More Resources and Tools
- codesandbox.io - lightweight, browser based sandbox for testing code etc.
